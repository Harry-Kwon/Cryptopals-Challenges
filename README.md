# Cryptopals-Challenges

A repository of my work based on the Cryptopals Challenges at http://cryptopals.com/.

## Goals
My primary goal is to learn about modern cryptography and attacks. A longer term goal would be to write a library of implementations based on the challenges for personal use on future projects.
